## Our Project Goal
This project aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of Japan's birth demographics over the past century (1899-2022) by analyzing collective data, with a specific focus on:
1. Total Fertility Rate (TFR):
•	Goal: Chart and analyze the TFR over 100 years, identifying periods of highs, lows, and fluctuations.
•	Expected Outcome: Understand the historical context and potential factors driving changes in TFR, such as economic conditions, social norms, and government policies.
2. Impact of Major Events on Stillbirths:
•	Goal: Investigate how major events, particularly World War II (1944-1946, despite data limitations), impacted fertility rates, stillbirth rates, and other key birth indicators.
•	Expected Outcome: Identify correlations between historical events and birth trends, providing valuable insights into societal responses to crises.
3. Rise of Out-of-Wedlock Births (ex-nuptial):
•	Goal: Analyze the trend in the number of children born out of wedlock over the past 50 years, considering potential contributing factors.
•	Expected Outcome: Understand the evolving cultural and legal landscape surrounding marriage and childbirth in Japan.
4. Male vs. Female Birth Rates:
•	Goal: Investigate any trends in the disparity between male and female birth rates, considering possible biological and social influences.
•	Expected Outcome: Gain insights into potential imbalances and their implications for future population demographics.
Additional Considerations:
Address data limitations due to World War II by exploring alternative sources
Consider incorporating contextual information like economic data, social policies, and cultural shifts for a richer analysis.

## What We Are Using 
Data Sources
* Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/japan-birth-statistics 
* List reference articles

Languages
* Python (Matplotlib, Pandas)

## Analysis

Male vs Female Birth Rates: 
Male vs female ratio is farily consistent at 51% male / 49% female.

## Additional Considerations and Limitations
Some data is missing between the years 1944-1946 due to records lost during World War II. 

Ex-Nuptial Births in Japan: 1947 - 2022
Note: Between the years 1947 and 2000, the data set reports ex-nuptial births every five years. From 2000 to 2022, it reports ex-nuptial births every year.
